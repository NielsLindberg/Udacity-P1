Your response goes here!

* Well I did kinda go through the same learnings when i did the 'About Me' project that has been removed recently. I did however focus on the feedback i got from that project and tried to use the HTML5 semantic elements more this time around.

* Since i already knew most of the stuff everything was very easy and more a matter of refreshing some stuff and getting alittle better at using HTML5 elements.

* Nothing really, but as I said i already had gone through similar material

* Hard to say, didn't have any big challenges. Used the element reference and the HTML5 outline guide on Mozilla.
